# Aliv-e

A simple uptime monitoring tool that checks whether your websites and APIs are up or down. You add a monitor with a URL and a schedule. The system fetches that URL on time, records the result, and shows you the latest status.

Built with **Astro** (front-end + API) and **Supabase** (Postgres, Edge Functions, pg_cron, pgmq). It runs on the free tier and has no extra services to pay for.

> [!NOTE]
> This project stores only the **latest state** of each monitor. It does not keep a history of every check.

---

## What's in it for you

- Track many URLs from one dashboard.
- Choose how often each one is checked (every 10 to 60 minutes).
- See live **UP / DOWN / PENDING** status, response time, and the last error.
- Pause and resume any monitor without deleting it.
- Checks are scheduled automatically — you do nothing after you create a monitor.

---

## How it works

Here is the flow when you add a monitor:

1. You create a monitor through the API or the dashboard.
2. A **scheduler** runs every minute. It finds monitors that are due for a check and puts their IDs into a queue.
3. A **worker** (a Supabase Edge Function) drains that queue. It fetches each URL, follows redirects, and saves the result.
4. The dashboard shows the newest status for every monitor.

```

Two cron jobs fire every minute:

- **Scheduler** — pure SQL. Finds due monitors and enqueues their IDs. It does no fetching, so it runs fast.
- **Consumer** — calls the `check-monitors` Edge Function. This one does the actual HTTP checks.

Because the scheduler and the worker are separate, one slow check never blocks the next scheduling round.

Unusual top-level files:

- `schema / migrations` — all database changes live under `supabase/migrations/`.
- `shared/` — imported by both the browser build and the server API routes, so it must stay dependency-light.
- `supabase/functions/` — Deno code (the Edge Function). It is **not** part of the Astro TypeScript project and is excluded from `pnpm check`.

## Architecture decisions

These are the main choices behind the design and why they were made.

**pgmq over an external queue (SQS / Kafka).**
pgmq is a Postgres-native queue that ships with Supabase. It adds no new service and no cost, and it is plenty for this scale. An external queue solves a scaling problem this project does not have.

**Scheduler / worker split.**
The scheduling tick (find due monitors, enqueue) and the execution (fetch URLs) run in separate steps. This keeps the scheduling query cheap and fast, and it means a batch of slow checks can never delay the next scheduling round.

**Atomic claim with a lease.**
When the worker picks up a monitor, it claims it with a single `UPDATE`. That claim sets a lease expiry. If two workers try to check the same monitor at once, only one wins. The other sees the lease and skips. This prevents double-checking without fragile compare-and-set logic.

**SSRF guard at both the API and the worker.**
A monitor URL must resolve only to public IPs. We reject URLs that point to private, loopback, link-local, or cloud-metadata addresses (for example `127.0.0.1` or `169.254.169.254`). We check this once when you create or edit a monitor, and again at fetch time, including every redirect hop. This stops a user from making the system fetch internal resources.

**Per-user monitor cap.**
Each user can create up to 20 monitors. The API checks the count before insert, and a database trigger enforces it too, so the limit holds even under concurrent requests.

**No auth in V1 (by decision).**
Monitors are tied to a username that the client supplies; there is no session and no row-level security. Anyone who knows a username can read or edit that user's monitors. This is a known gap and was a deliberate choice while the tool is single-user. See **Roadmap**.

---

## Roadmap (future features)

These are planned or considered but not built yet.

- **Auth and ownership (RLS).** Add Supabase Auth and row-level security so each user can only see and edit their own monitors. This is the biggest remaining item.
- **Debounce before DOWN.** Only mark a monitor DOWN after two failed checks in a row, to avoid flapping on one short outage.
- **Uptime history.** Save every check to a log table so you can show uptime percentage over time.
- **Alerting.** Send email, webhook, or Slack notifications when a monitor goes DOWN.
- **Multi-region checks.** Check a URL from more than one place for better accuracy.

Explicitly out of scope for now: an external queue and a horizontally scaled worker fleet.

---

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (18+) and **pnpm**
- **Deno** (to run the Edge Function locally)
- **Supabase CLI** (to push migrations and deploy the function)
- A **Supabase project** (cloud or local)

---

## Getting started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Set up environment variables

Copy the example file and fill in real values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and replace the placeholders:

| Variable | What it is | Where from |
|---|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Your project's API URL | Supabase dashboard → Settings → API |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Safe, browser-side key | Same page |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Server-only key (never ship it) | Same page |
| `WORKER_SECRET` | A random secret shared with the worker | You create this |

> [!WARNING]
> Never commit real keys. `.env` is in `.gitignore`. Only `.env.example` is tracked.

### 3. Apply the database schema

Push the migrations to your Supabase project:

```bash
supabase db push
```

Or, for a fully local setup:

```bash
supabase init
supabase start
supabase db reset
```

### 4. Deploy the worker (Edge Function)

```bash
supabase functions deploy check-monitors
```

The worker needs these secrets set on the project:

```bash
supabase secrets set SUPABASE_URL=... SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=... WORKER_SECRET=...
```

The cron job that invokes the worker authenticates with a bearer token stored in Supabase **Vault** under the name `worker_secret`. Set that secret to the same value as `WORKER_SECRET`.

> [!TIP]
> The scheduler and consumer cron schedules are created by the migrations. If you change a check interval or the timeout cap, revisit the queue sizing together (visibility timeout, batch size, concurrency) — don't tune one without the others.

### 5. Run the app

Local development:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open the dashboard at `http://localhost:4321/dashboard/<username>`.

Production build and preview:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm preview
```

---

## Scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pnpm dev` | Start the Astro dev server |
| `pnpm build` | Build the app for production |
| `pnpm preview` | Preview a production build |
| `pnpm check` | Type-check the Astro project |
| `pnpm biome:check` | Lint and format-check the project |

---

## Using the API

The CRUD endpoints live under `/api/monitors`.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/monitors` | Create a monitor |
| `GET` | `/api/monitors?username=...` | List a user's monitors |
| `PATCH` | `/api/monitors/:id` | Update a monitor (rename, edit URL, change interval/timeout, pause / resume) |
| `DELETE` | `/api/monitors/:id` | Delete a monitor |

Check intervals: `10, 14, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60` minutes.
Timeouts: `1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60` seconds.
URLs must be `http` or `https` and must resolve to public IPs only.
Usernames run 3–10 chars: lowercase letters, numbers, `_` or `-`.

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. To keep the code consistent:

- Make sure `pnpm check`, `pnpm build`, and `pnpm biome:check` all pass.
- The worker in `supabase/functions/` is Deno. It is not covered by the Astro checks, so run `deno check` and `deno test` there separately (see `supabase/functions/check-monitors/check-monitors.test.ts`).
- Keep shared utility code in `shared/` small and dependency-free.
